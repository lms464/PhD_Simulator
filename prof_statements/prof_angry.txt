What have you been doing for two weeks?
That could have gone better..
You need to graduate soon.
So... there's nothing new to report?
We can't use that for the presentation.
That's not appropriate fo the paper.
I think this project is done.
..
Huh..
These statistics don't make sense...
That goes against the whole project.

Take the day off...
